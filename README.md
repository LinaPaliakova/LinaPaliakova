## About Me
I started my journey in IT 5 years ago. Since then, I have been continuously learning and honing my skills as a Technical support and SRE engineer. My primary programming languages are Python and Bash, but I'm always eager to explore new technologies and languages.

Feel free to explore my repositories:)
